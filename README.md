# Bet-no-loss

> Tagline: Bet on a sport event without loosing your stake and get rewarded if you win.

## Description

- Players bet on a sport event during week 1.  
- The total amount of bets (all players included) is then staked in DeFi during week 2.  
- Finally at the end of week 3, 90% of accrued interests can be split between winners according to their share in the total deposit value. 
Each winner can then withdraw the 90% accrued interests in DeFi proportionally to his/her initial stake.

- Edit `.env` and set the below `property = "value"` pairs (one per line):

```
MNEMONIC          = "TODO_enter_your_own_12_words_seed_here"
INFURA_PROJECT_ID = "TODO_infura_project_id_here"
```

Keep in mind to surround each value with double quotes.

# Documentation

Each smart-contract is documented in a Markdown file in `client/src/contracts`.

Should you need to update the documentation, simply run:
```
npx leafleth -s contracts
```

# Decisions

- Crypto-currency used: DAI
- DeFi Service used: For now none, due to time constraints we will stub them. Later on: Compound or AAVE ?
- No Back-Office for now.  
  As we focus only on having a running project with smart contract + front-office.
  This means in order to add events the owner calls the ad-hoc smart-contract's functions.
