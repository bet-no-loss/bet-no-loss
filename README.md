# Decisions

- Crypto-currency used: DAI
- DeFi Service used: to be determined Compound or AAVE ?
- No Back-Office for now.  
  As we focus only on having a running project with smart contract + front-office.
  This means in order to add events the owner calls the ad-hoc smart-contract's functions.
